In this lab, I was able to complete both Requirements successfully. 

Requirement 1 ----

Suppose that towers(5, 2, 3) is invoked.

1.   The first recursive call will be towers (4, 2, 1).

2.   towers will go through 5 recursive calls.

3.   The first move is a disk from tower 2 to tower 3.

4.   The second recursive call will be towers (0,3,2).

Suppose that towers(8, 1, 2) is invoked. How many lines will be printed to stdout?

255 ines will be printed out.
